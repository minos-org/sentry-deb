Description: Safe and effective protection against bruteforce attacks
 Sentry detects and prevents bruteforce attacks against sshd using minimal
 system resources. Most bruteforce blocking apps (denyhosts, fail2ban,
 sshdfilter) expect to run as a daemon, tailing a log file. That requires a
 language interpreter to always be running, consuming at least 10MB of RAM.
 .
 Sentry uses resources only when connections are made. Once an IP is blacklisted
 for abuse, whether by tcpd or a firewall, the resources it can consume are
 practically zero. See more information at: https://www.tnpi.net/wiki/Sentry
